# 👋 Hi, I'm lyscf

LZU (Lanzhou University) — Information Security  

I work mainly on penetration testing and code auditing,  
and I’m continuously exploring network traffic analysis and digital forensics.

I participate in CTF competitions and build security-related tools in my spare time.

## 🧩 Areas of Interest

- Web / Network Penetration Testing  
- Code Auditing & Vulnerability Analysis  
- Network Traffic Analysis  
- Digital Forensics  

Beyond exploitation itself, I’m interested in understanding attack behavior and reconstructing what actually happened from traffic and artifacts.
